{\scriptsize\textit{* Limited to reveal the comparison of only one of the following: Strength score, Dexterity score, Constitution score, Armor Class, or hit points.}}\\
\\
You use Charisma as your spellcasting ability for these cantrips.\\
\\
\dndtitle{16pt}{Wings}
From 2nd level you become capable of creating wings to fly with, as a bonus action you extrude draconic wings from your back. This grants you a fly speed of 60 ft. And lasts for 10 minutes.

\indent After using this ability you must finish a short rest before using it again.\\
\indent Once you reach 10th character level, you are no longer limited to having the wings for 10 minutes only. And you no longer need to complete a short rest before using it again.\\
\\
\dndtitle{16pt}{Draconic Appraise}
At 2nd level, your draconic ancestry gives you great understanding of the value of gems, precious metals, coins and jewellery. You can use a full round to determine the value of a single gem, bar of precious metal, a 1000 coint or one piece of jewellery.\\
\\

\end{tabu}\opac{1}
\indent Additionally if you have your breath weapon expended at the time of rolling initiative you regain it's use.\\
\\
