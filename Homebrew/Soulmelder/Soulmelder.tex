\dndtitle{26pt}{Soulmelder}
A women standing atop of a hill, with glowing blue eyes and armor and weapons just apearing out of no where, all of it seems to be made of some energy but still very real.\\
\indent At the edge of the forest stands a man, in simple clothing looking mostly like a druid, but his face resembles that of a menacing Basilisk with his hands shaped like the Sphinx's great paws. At times he looks almost like the legendary Terrasque\\
\indent A man in heavy armor, with a normal sword standing in front of a horde of goblins. As he swings his sword it radiates with energy and a huge sweeping blow cuts the head clean of most of the goblins.\\
\indent Soulmelders are unpredictable, you never know what they have planned, but they are different and some have sworn things akin to paladins, and others just act on some ideal.\\
\\
\dndtitle{16pt}{Inborn Energy}
All creatures have access to the energy called incarnum, but not all are taught how to shape it. This is how the soulmelders prevail, some of them are taught it much the same as a wizard is taught spells, while some are taught in secluded orders like paladins, and then some discover their power alone and just realize they can shape incarnum.\\
\\
\dndtitle{16pt}{Rarely Indifferent}
Most soulborn cares about most that happens around them. Some adhere to some ideal or set code, or they just want to react to the world around them for no other reason than to react.\\
\\
\dndtitle{16pt}{Creating a Soulmelder}
How did your character discover his powers? Was he taught how to tap into the powers of the incarnum or did he simply stumble upon them in a dire situation? How did he react to this new found power? With digust, fear or another emotion? What kind of ideal does he live by? Or maybe he has nor ideals?\\
\\
\dndtitle{14pt}{Quickbuild}
First make Constitution your highest ability score, then Strength or Dexterity depending on the type of weapon you are going to use if any.\\
